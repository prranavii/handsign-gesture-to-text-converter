# Hand Sign Gesture to Text Converter

## 🧠 Project Description  
This project captures hand gestures (signs) via webcam and converts them into text in real-time. It aims to help bridge the communication gap between sign-language users and people who do not understand sign language — providing an accessible, machine-vision based solution for gesture-to-text translation.

## Features  
- Real-time hand detection via webcam.  
- Recognition of predefined hand-sign gestures corresponding to letters/words.  
- Conversion of recognized gestures into human-readable text output.  
- (Optional/Future) Expandable gesture set — you can add custom gestures by collecting more training data.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python** — main programming language.  
- **OpenCV** — for capturing video frames from webcam and image preprocessing.  
- (Optional) Any ML/DL libraries (if used) for gesture classification.
